# IoT Based Air Pollution Monitoring System

## Project Title:
#### ***A low-cost IoT based air-pollution monitoring for smart cities using drone-based calibration and machine learning***
## Project Summary:
#### ***Ambient and household air pollution is a major environmental risk to health, disproportionately affecting countries with low and medium income including a large population in India. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 91% of the world population are living in places where the WHO air quality guidelines levels were not met and 91% of premature deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, and the greatest number in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions [1].***

***The primary cause of mortality, cardiovascular-respiratory disease and cancer are due to exposure to small particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less in diameter known as PM2.5. Other responsible pollutants are PM10, Ozone (O3), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2).***

***To tackle this problem, we must monitor the pollutants spatially (space) and temporarily (time) with very fine resolution, especially in cities, within meters and minutes, respectively. In doing so, it will allow cities, communities, health facilities, schools, and workplaces to plan and evolve to reduce these dangerous pollutants and eventually improve the lives and wellbeing of residents.***
